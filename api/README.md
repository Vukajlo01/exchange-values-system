# Flask API Project

Welcome to the Flask API project! This project provides a basic structure for building a RESTful API using Flask, a popular Python web framework. This README will guide you through setting up a virtual environment, installing the required dependencies, and activating it on a Windows system.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your Windows system:

- Python 3.x (You can download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/))

### Setting Up a Virtual Environment

A virtual environment is a clean, isolated environment for your project's dependencies. It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies for your Flask API project.

1. Open a command prompt or PowerShell in the project's root directory.

2. Install the `virtualenv` package if you haven't already. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install virtualenv

3. Create a virtual environment by running the following command:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

   This will create a virtual environment named `venv` in your project directory.

### Installing Dependencies

To install the required dependencies for this project, you can use the `requirements.txt` file.

1. Make sure your virtual environment is activated (see the next section on how to activate it).

2. Run the following command to install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Activating the Virtual Environment

Before you can run the Flask API, you need to activate your virtual environment.

#### On Windows (PowerShell):

1. Navigate to your project directory in the command prompt or PowerShell.

2. Activate the virtual environment by running the following command:

   ```powershell
   .\venv\Scripts\Activate
   ```

   You should now see the virtual environment name in your command prompt or PowerShell, indicating that it's active.

## Project Structure

Here is a brief overview of the project's directory structure:


- `controllers/`: This directory may contain your application's controller files.
- `database/`: Here, you can store database-related files or scripts.
- `env/`: This directory is typically used for environment-related configurations or files.
- `models/`: You can place your application's data models or schemas here.
- `routes/`: This is where you can define your API routes.
- `services/`: You can place any service classes or modules in this directory.

- `__init__.py`: An empty file that marks the directory as a Python package.
- `config.py`: Configuration file for your Flask application.
- `index.py`: The main entry point for running your Flask API.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the project's dependencies for easy installation.

You can organize your project's files and logic within these directories to follow best practices and maintain a clean project structure.


- `app/`: This directory contains the Flask application and its components.
- `venv/`: The virtual environment directory where dependencies are isolated.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories that should be ignored by version control.
- `README.md`: The file you are currently reading.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the project's dependencies for easy installation.
- `run.py`: The main entry point for running the Flask API.

## Running the API

To start the Flask API, run the following command within the activated virtual environment:

```bash
python run.py
```

This will start the development server, and your API will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000/`.
